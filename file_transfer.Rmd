Copying the relevant scripts to the chicken/salmon folder.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```

Copy raw data layer files over. We only need the broiler and salmon aquaculture ones, but I am moving everything over in case we find we need something extra.

```{r}
from <- list.files("/home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/all_food_systems/datalayers", pattern=".tif")
to: /home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/chicken_salmon/datalayers


file.copy(file.path(rawPath, dataFiles), dataPath, overwrite = TRUE)
```
