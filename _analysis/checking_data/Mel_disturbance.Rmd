Just a quick check of crop occupancy for general methods:
```{r}

library(countrycode)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

corn_disturb <- raster("/home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/final_data/_tif_version/crop_maiz_disturbance.tif")

corn_org <- raster("/home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/_raw_data/map_spam_crop_data/spam2010v1r1_global_phys_area.geotiff/spam2010V1r1_global_A_MAIZ_A.tif")
plot(corn_org)

diff <- corn_org*0.01 - corn_disturb
plot(diff)
click(diff)

corn_disturb <- read_csv("/home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/final_data/crop_maiz_disturbance.csv", col_types = "ddd")
tmp <- rasterFromXYZ(corn_disturb)
plot(tmp)


corn_occu <- raster("/home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/_raw_data/map_spam_crop_data/spam2010v1r1_global_phys_area.geotiff/spam2010V1r1_global_A_MAIZ_A.tif")

```

Difference plot shows differences of << 1.  This is rounding error!  Looks good.
